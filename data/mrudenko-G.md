1) Storage is one of the most expensive operations in terms of gas. Reducing storage writes can save a significant amount of gas.

For example, in the overrideRange function:
```
ranges[indexToModify] = Range(
        newStart,
        newEnd,
        newDailyIR,
        newPrevRangeClosePrice
      );

```
Instead of creating a new Range struct every time, you can modify the existing one:
```
ranges[indexToModify].start = newStart;
ranges[indexToModify].end = newEnd;
ranges[indexToModify].dailyInterestRate = newDailyIR;
ranges[indexToModify].prevRangeClosePrice = newPrevRangeClosePrice;
```

The contract imports both IERC20Upgradeable and IERC20MetadataUpgradeable. However, IERC20MetadataUpgradeable already extends IERC20Upgradeable, so you only need to import IERC20MetadataUpgradeable.
```
import "contracts/external/openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/token/ERC20/IERC20MetadataUpgradeable.sol";
```
The _beforeTokenTransfer function is marked as internal but is only used within the contract. Consider changing its visibility to private unless you expect derived contracts to use it.
