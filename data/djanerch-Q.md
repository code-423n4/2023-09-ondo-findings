**Summary**

The `setOracle` function in the `rUSDY.sol` contract doesn't check if the `_oracle` address is valid. This oversight can lead to problems if the contract owner mistakenly sets the address to `address(0)`.

**Details:**

The `setOracle` function in the `rUSDY.sol` contract allows the contract owner to update the Oracle address. However, it doesn't verify the validity of the `_oracle` address provided as input. This could create issues within the contract, particularly if the owner accidentally sets `_oracle` to the Ethereum zero address, `address(0)`.

**Suggested Fix:**

To improve the contract's security and reliability, it's advisable to include a simple check. Before updating the Oracle address, ensure that `_oracle` is not equal to `address(0)`. You can implement this fix as shown below:

```solidity
function setOracle(address _oracle) external onlyRole(USDY_MANAGER_ROLE) {
    require(_oracle != address(0), "Invalid oracle address");
    oracle = IRWADynamicOracle(_oracle); 
}
```

**Benefits of the Fix:**

- Increases the security of the `rUSDY.sol` contract by verifying input data.
- Prevents unintended issues and potential disruptions caused by mistakenly setting the Oracle address to `address(0)`.
