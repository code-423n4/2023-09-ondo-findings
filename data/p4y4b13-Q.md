## Low Risk and Non-Critical Issues

## 1. Incorrect Natspec @notice in addChainSupport() function in DestinationBridge.sol

[https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-09-ondo/blob/main/contracts/bridge/DestinationBridge.sol#L228-L229](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-09-ondo/blob/main/contracts/bridge/DestinationBridge.sol#L228-L229)

The `addChainSupport()` function is used stores the mapping of chain to bridge contract address.However the @notice(comments) above the function is incorrect. It says, the function is used to initalize a nested mapping in which spent nonces from this `srcAddress` are logged and prevented from being reused.

## Recommendation

Change the incorrect comments
